Application for free parking spaces searching 

In the modern world, the number of cars is growing exponentially. "Free Parking Space Finder" is an integrated system designed to facilitate the process of finding and paying for parking for drivers.
The project's area of application includes urban infrastructure and commercial parking zones. The project aims to reduce the time spent on searching for free spots and optimize the use of parking spaces. The application provides users with real-time information about available spaces, allows for parking payment and control of the parking space usage history, as well as receiving notifications about possible violations.
This service can be used by municipalities, owners of private parking lots and shopping centers, as well as drivers wishing to save time and money when searching for and paying for parking.
